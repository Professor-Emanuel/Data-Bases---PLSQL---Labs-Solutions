# Data-Bases---PLSQL---Labs-Solutions

The file_to_create_student_schema & file_to_populate_tables are useful to get past the setup part.

The exercise statements can be found at the end of each labY, and the possible solutions are in the files EmanuelKokovicsX, which I am to lazy to rename now, but X (number) in the solution names doesn't necessarily coincide with the Y (number) of the lab names.

Don't be lazy like me!
